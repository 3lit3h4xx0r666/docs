#### seren

### Real-Debrid
This is a pay service that caches the content you stream on kodi. 
All you really need to understand is that you'll get faster downloads with 
this and your video wont buffer. 4$ a month, totally worth it.

It also allows you to download the files from a bunch of those anonymous hosting 
sites that make you wait 60 seconds for the "slow" download. 

Like the ones linked from some of the sites below.

## Music Downloads

I love this site: [productoilicito2.blogspot.com/]. Whoever made this managed to catalog what appears to be the hip-hop genre in it's entirety.

There are your various torrent sites, but you'll need to read about this [https://interviewfor.red/en/index.html] to get access to anything beyond what's available on public trackers. I'm not sure it's worth the effort and the demands on one's time, and I've been pretty happy with what I can find on the above, public trackers, [https://losslesscatalog.com] and similar sites.
